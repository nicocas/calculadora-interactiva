# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

This is a project of the React course of FreeCodeCamp; Originally, the variables names was in spanish, but in the search of get practice on my english, i renamed all of them. This calculator can add, subtract, multiply and get a quotient for natural numbers. And give an alert if you want to do an operation without any number.
